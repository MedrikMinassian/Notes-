the idea of OOP is that everything in our code is an object.
Everything in the outside world is an object therefore everything in our programming world is an object too. 
A tree has some properties like trunk, leave, roots, branches. 
Example of a tree; It interacts with the environment, tree grows, leaves fall. (these are behaviors)
Properties of a tree/objects are attributes. 
Bheviors are methods. 
We have a planning stage where we write a lot of code it is called blueprint. 
In the implementation stage we create methods. 
CLASS, ATTRIBUTES, METHODS
each class will have instances/objects
OOP kind of allows you to organize your codes by creating relationships between lines of codes
