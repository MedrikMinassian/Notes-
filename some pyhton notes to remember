how are lists and tuples similar they have indexes and access values the same way. 
conditionals 
if 
elif
else 
if we have all three grouped together if one of those conditions is true it wont run anything else 

if we have two ifs one after another it will compare both and will run if they are both true or wont run if they are both false. 
Operators are 
== (and)
<= (or)
>= (not)
!= < >

Operator	Description	Example
==	Checks if the value of two operands are equal	1 == 2 => False
1 == 1 => True
!=	Checks if the value of two operands are not equal	1 != 2 => True
1 != 1 => False
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand	1 > 2 => False
2 > 1 => True
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand	1 < 2 => True
2 < 1 => False
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand	1 >= 2 => False
2 >= 2 => True
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand	1 <= 2 => True
2 <= 2 => True
and	Checks that each expression on the left and right are both True	(1 <= 2) and (2 <= 3) => True
(1 <= 2) and (2 >= 3) => False
(1 >= 2) and (2 >= 3) => False
or	Checks if either the expression on the left or right is True	(1 <= 2) or (2 >= 3) => True
(1 <= 2) or (2 <= 3) => True
(1 >= 2) or (2 >= 3) => False
not	Reverses the true-false value of the operand	not True => False
not False => True
not 1 >= 2 => True
not 1 <= 2 => False
not (1 <= 2 and 2 >= 3)  => True
not 1 <= 2 and 2 >= 3 => False
