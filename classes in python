lists are like array in java script they have indexes 0 to infinity. 
they have built in functions. 
they are defined by square brackets []
if you have a list you can use your list name and then . to create list specific methods
for example 
list.pop
list.append 
list.remove
list.index
list.reverse
list.sort
list.extend 
list.insert
list.clear
list.count
list.copy

here are some python built in functions
len(sequence) 
max(sequence)
min(sequence)
sorted(sequence)

here is an example to use lists as stacks. 

stack =[3,4,5]
stack.append(6)
stack.append(7)
run stack
stack [3,4,5,6,7]
stack.pop()
7
stack [3,4,5,6]
stack.pop()
stack[3,4,5]
