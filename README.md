# Notes-
Most of these are ReadMe Files 
Here is how to run a file from terminal on VSCode (Visual Studio Code) üßë‚Äçüíª 
Open VSCode
press CMD + SHIFT + P
top dropdown will open
type 'shell command' 
then from the list choose 'Install code command in path'
Go back to terminal choose basic commands like ls cd mkdir to enter your desired directory
ls is 'List'
so for example 'ls Desktop' will show you a list of all the files you have on your desktop
cd Desktop or chdir Destkop will change directory and take you inside your desired location 
then you write 'code' accompanied with file name to create a new file
to open an alredy created file you will write code -r then the file name and it will open the file for you. 
If this doesn't work leave a comment and I will followup on your comment.
