loops allow us to iterate through code 
for example if we want to print hello world five times 
the range funciton creates a sequence 
for example 
for i in range (50) 
print (i)
will print 0 to 49 
the start point is inclusive 
the step is inclusie 
the stop is exclusive 
EXAMPLE
for x in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(x)
# output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
for x in range(5, 1, -3):
    print(x)
# output: 5, 2

# Challenge: Write a for loop to print all integers from 1 to 20, including 20.

for x in range(1,21)
print (x)
